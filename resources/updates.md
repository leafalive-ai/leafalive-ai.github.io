Updates from the weekend

In the past 36 hours, we focused on making the plant feel truly alive by giving it a voice, personality, and emotional intelligence. We built a voice-first chat interface with text-to-speech so the plant speaks aloud, added a walkie-talkie interaction model for hands-free communication, and redesigned the persona system so sensor data is expressed as emotions rather than raw numbers, with species awareness and proactive, time-based greetings. We also completed a full UI overhaul featuring a warm botanical visual theme, an animated home screen with swipe panels and drag-to-reorder, and iMessage-style chat bubbles. Finally, we strengthened device reliability through improved WiFi provisioning and hardened BLE connections.

Pitch Deck

We’re building LeafAlive, an AI-powered plant companion that transforms real biological signals into emotionally grounded conversations.
Instead of alerts and dashboards, your plant develops a voice, a personality, and a relationship with you.


Most houseplants don’t survive their first year.
Not because people don’t care, but because care is inconsistent.
Life gets busy.
And current technology only reacts after something goes wrong.
Without emotional connection, there’s no lasting commitment.


LeafAlive combines real-time biological sensing with a persistent AI persona.
The plant’s tone and personality are grounded in its actual environmental state.
But what makes it different is proactive design.
Instead of reacting to emergencies, the plant gently initiates conversations and builds small care rituals over time.
This shifts the experience from alerts to relationship.

Today’s plant technology is one-directional.
 You care for the plant.
 It sends you alerts.
 That turns care into a chore.
LeafAlive creates a bidirectional relationship.
 You care for the plant’s biological needs.
 And the plant responds emotionally, checks in, and becomes a gentle presence in your life.
Care becomes connection.



LeafAlive begins with live biological sensing.
We translate those signals into a dynamic health score and persona model.
That mood shapes a persistent AI persona with memory and voice.
And instead of waiting for problems, the plant proactively initiates care to humans and conversations. 

This creates a bidirectional loop.
You care for the plant’s biological needs.
The plant responds emotionally and becomes a gentle presence in your life.

The opportunity is large and growing.
 Sixty-six percent of U.S. households own houseplants, and the gardening industry exceeds fifty billion dollars annually.
 At the same time, smart home devices and AI companions are rapidly normalizing emotionally expressive interfaces.
Existing solutions either provide dashboards and reminders, or raw sensor data.
 None combine real biological sensing with emotionally grounded AI.
 That’s the gap LeafAlive fills.
